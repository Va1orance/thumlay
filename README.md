# Thumlay
A list of all the thumb alpha utilizing layouts!

The **textual measurements for metric** are as follows:
- **Perfect:** 0% or 100% depending on metric
- **Best:** Current **best** in this metric (single thumb)
- **Excellent:** Top 20 in metric (overall, excluding multi-thumb)
- **Great:** Top 30 in metric (overall, excluding multi-thumb)
- **Good:** Top 40 in metric (overall, excluding multi-thumb)
- **Decent:** Top 50 in metric (overall, excluding multi-thumb)
- **Average:** Top 100 in metric (overall, excluding multi-thumb)
- **Mediocre:** Top 200 in metric (overall, excluding multi-thumb, layouts featuring this can earn at best "I would **consider this layout**".
- **Poor:** Top 500 in metric (would **NOT** recommend this layout flat out, **consider** only for special case due to this statistic)
- **Bad:** Obvious flaws in design (would **NOT** recommend **NOR** consider this layout due to this statistic)

Layout metrics will be ranked via [Cmini] (https://github.com/Apsu/cmini) using the MT-Quotes corpus.

Please note, these are in **a single metric**. Also these will be taken with *creative liberty* as many metrics are filled with "trash" (not bad or shaming, but just not useful) layouts trying to optimize for that one metric. Leads to the entire leaderboard being filled up, which is partially why I included up to Top 20, for "Excellent". I will likely take one or two of the top metric layouts regardless to demonstrate their overall capabilities.

For non-percentile based metrics:
- Perfect -> Bad "Keymap": A perfect keymap will look like differs from person to person. For this, I will be using:
```
3.0 2.0 1.5 1.7 3.0 3.0 1.7 1.5 2.0 3.0
1.2 1.1 1.0 1.0 2.3 2.3 1.0 1.0 1.1 1.2
3.0 2.5 2.3 1.5 2.7 2.7 1.5 2.3 2.5 3.0
            1.0
```
Everybody differs and what I have laid out here is even different from what I personally prefer. However, this layout seems to address most peoples' feelings to within + or - 0.3 so I will leave it at that.
- Keep in mind this is primarily meant for Colstag (Column-staggered), Ortholinear will be slightly different (punish low-middle more, middle two columns, etc.)

**Theory and Notes:**
The system I have come up here is to--at a quick glace--get an idea of the layout. It is not meant to be your final deciding factor. I tried to keep all the bullet points textual measurements (hence numerical rankings) as obvious bias would slip into layouts I designed, or liked. That being said, you will find a short summary above and below the texual measurements where I try and highlight the main benefits and negatives of the layout. These **will likely by impacted by bias** so accept them with caution. The "I will recommend this" is a great example. Nevertheless, I feel at least some sort of summary system is needed to compress the hundreds of layouts into a digestible, quick-to-read form.

Quick list of potential FAQs:
- "Why are textual measurments based off Top of #?": Due to the alt layout community being ever changing, there's bound to be something new that disrupts the current "good %" (especially with thumb-alpha layouts being relatively untapped). Therefore, by considering by ranking, I am able to avoid having to constantly update the "good %".
- "Why exclude multi-thumb keys (>1) layouts?": 1) More common-and cheaper-models of keyboard usually only support having 1 thumb key. 2) Having multiple thumb keys unveils whole new areas of consideration (how bad or good is thumb movement, how do rolls work, etc.) that I'm just not ready for. It also wouldn't fit well with single thumb layouts (practically always beating them), so ultimately it would have to be its own section. Someday:tm: though!
- "Why not give a score based on averaging metrics": Despite the data, this is still a subjective hobby. There is a more than likely chance I will like something you don't and vice versa. Thus, I do not feel comfortable ranking layouts this way. That being said, I will try and keep an updated list of good layouts, but with the current popularity of thumb layouts, it is going to be very biased towards me.
- "Why include non-thumb layouts?": There are not enough thumb layouts that occupy top or reasonable postions in rankings. Without accounting for the general metric, nearly every thumb layout as of this point (2/21/24) would be able to fall comfortably into good or great. Plus, you don't want to be getting an extra key only for it to be worse than without.
Do understand though, thumb keys do have a problem with double letters, making it a bit difficult to compare.
- "Why so harsh on the grading?": Layouts are so good these days that practically you can't go wrong. Any benefits are more likely to be placebo than any real tangible improvement (in the long run). However, that means in order to differentiate them, I have to be harsh and critical.
