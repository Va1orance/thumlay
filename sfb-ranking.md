Layouts here will be ranked by SFBs via [Cmini] (https://github.com/Apsu/cmini) using the MT-Quotes corpus.
- Currently only one thumb-alpha layouts will be accepted.
- Layouts must include an apostrophe key and punctuation.
- LSBs will be accounted for soon.

Created by me. Attempts to create with SFB optimization as a priority, while maintaining good stats in other areas.
This receives **a recommendation from me**.
- Excellent SFB%
- Very Good redirect% (very due to 0.10% bad)
- Decent rolls%
- Decent keymap
- Decent SFS%

Bonus:
- STR onehand
  
But keep in mind:
- TH is an outroll.
- PNB column, relatively high movement.
- Some people may mind the high movement LHM column.

  Rtl: 45.53%   (In/Out: 21.33% | 24.20%)
  Red:  2.33%   (Bad:     0.24%)

  SFB: 0.35%
  SFS: 4.29%    (Red/Alt: 0.74% | 3.55%)

  LH/RH: 49.92% | 50.08%
```

Created by me. Currently is **my top** layout, and *the one I am currently using*.
Compared to Snert, it fixes the TH outroll, and *better* utilizes optimal key positions.
This receives **a recommendation from me**.
- Excellent SFB%
- Great redirects%
- Good SFS%
- Good onehand%
- Better keymap
- Decent rolls%

Bonus:
- STR onehand

But keep in mind:
- K on bottom ring.
- Some people may mind the high movement LHM column.

  LH/RH: 50.02% | 49.98%
```

Lots of my layout design choices were influenced by this layout. The BNP column, HLM column, etc. Overall is a well designed layout with an interesting keymap.
This recieves **a recommendation from me**.
- Excellent SFB%
- Very good SFS%
- Good redirect% (loses very due to high bad redirects%)
- Good onehand%
- Good keymap (interesting*)
- Decent rolls%

Bonus:
- STR onehand

But keep this in mind:
- BNP column, relatively high movement.
- FS high-ish usage pinky

An RSHT homerow layout featuring a normal-ish keymap. There is likely more optimization available; it was a test layout I was messing around with.
Although it performs pretty well, I cannot recommend it as there is no reason to use this layout.
This recieves **a consideration from me** if you want to use an RSHT homerow.
- Great SFB%
- Very good onehand%
- Good redirects%
- Good rolls%
- Better keymap
- Average SFS%

But keep this in mind:
- STR is a redirect
- Some people may mind the high movement LHM column.
- P on one of the middle columns
